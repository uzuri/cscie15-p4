Fantasy Name Generator; primarily built from scratch, this project is about practicing with databases in Laravel and will let you build out fake languages via rules and phonemes.  

## Known issues

This project isn't as complete as I'd like it to be, though I believe it at least covers the bare bones.   I do know that there are problems if you have no languages in the database (so please don't delete the example languages on the live site if you can help it).   

As of 12/11 there are known spots where data is not properly vetted (it's possible to have numbers be phonemes, for example... maybe in your fantasy language numbers are acceptable letters, who knows?) before entry into the database.



## Future additions

If I'd had time, I would have liked to have adde the following:

+ Authentication (ONLY edit your own languages; set a language as public or private)
+ Create full profiles for yourself as a user
+ "Favorite" generated words
+ Snag words for use as character names and build character profiles around them
+ Expand rulesets for phonemes, eg. disallow certain phonemes from appearing in the middle of words.
+ Allow/Disallow single-phoneme words
+ Set maximum word length (in phonemes)
